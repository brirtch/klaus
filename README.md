# klaus
Klaus is my personal static site generator. It's kind of like Hugo, but I want it to be easier to use.

For your site, have the following folders:
 content - put your Markdown and any other static assets here.
 templates\main.html - main HTML template
 templates\main.css - main template's CSS
 published - folder where your site will be published
 
 
Then run klaus from your site folder. It will place the published site in the published folder.
