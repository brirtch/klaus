KLAUS - A very simple static site generator


All files and folder


KEY POINTS
- Your markdown files containing your page content must go in the "content" folder. Markdown
  files must have a .md extension. When you run Klaus, these files will be combined with the 
  maintemplate "template\main.html" to produce HTML in the "published" folder. Klaus will
  recreate any folders that you create in the "content" folder in the "published" folder.
